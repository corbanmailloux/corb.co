[Shredify.me (now hosted at shredify.corb.co)](http://shredify.corb.co/) is a site that matches excellent celebrity photos (like "Shreddy White" here) with excellent (read: ridiculous) metal versions of related music.

{{< image src="betty-white.jpg" alt="Shreddy White" class="shredify-image" >}}

For example, we have:

- ["Taylor Shrift" with a metal cover of "Blank Space"](http://shredify.corb.co/taylor/)
- [Barack "Who-Shred" Obama with a homemade metal cover of "Hail to the Chief"](http://shredify.corb.co/obama/)
- [Reba McEnShred with a metal cover of her '90s hit "Fancy"](http://shredify.corb.co/reba/)

The result is available at [shredify.corb.co](http://shredify.corb.co/), and the code is [available on {{< fontawesome github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/shredify.me).

Any questions can be directed at shredify.me@corb.co.
