Here are the details for the wedding of Maggie Russ and Corban Mailloux!

If you've been invited, we look forward to seeing you on **September 18th, 2021 at 4:00pm** for the intimate ceremony, followed by dinner, drinks, and a fun backyard party!

The wedding will be located at Tali and Jake's house at [574 Four Mile Brook Rd, Northfield, MA 01360](https://goo.gl/maps/7srLSTH7vRgA1bb89).

For drivers unfamiliar with the area:

- There are dirt roads in this area, and Google/Apple Maps won't always take you on the best path. To avoid issues, we recommend navigating to [781 Millers Falls Rd, Northfield, MA 01360](https://goo.gl/maps/aojHUo26Q249UBii8) first and then proceeding to [Tali and Jake's house](https://goo.gl/maps/7srLSTH7vRgA1bb89).
- GPS apps indicate that the house is a bit earlier on the street than it really is. There will be signs, but don't be surprised if you have to continue driving after the GPS says you've arrived.

## Dress Code

Please take inspiration from the color palette below when choosing your outfit so we can ensure our family photos are cohesive. Women would look best in nice sundresses or equivalent separates, while men should wear nice button-down shirts and khakis or slacks.

We are hoping to wrap up our night with a bonfire, so please consider bringing a change of clothes so that you are comfortable to enjoy a sâ€™more!
