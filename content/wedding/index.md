Here are the details for the wedding of Maggie Russ and Corban Mailloux!

If you've been invited, we look forward to seeing you on **September 18th, 2021 at 3:30pm** for the intimate ceremony, followed by dinner, ice cream, drinks, and a fun backyard party!

The wedding will be located at Tali and Jake's house at [574 Four Mile Brook Rd, Northfield, MA 01360](https://goo.gl/maps/7srLSTH7vRgA1bb89).

Notes for drivers unfamiliar with Northfield:

- There are dirt roads in this area, and Google/Apple Maps won't always take you the best path. To avoid issues, we recommend navigating to [781 Millers Falls Rd, Northfield, MA 01360](https://goo.gl/maps/aojHUo26Q249UBii8) first and then proceeding to [Tali and Jake's house](https://goo.gl/maps/7srLSTH7vRgA1bb89).
- GPS apps indicate that the house is a bit earlier on the street than it really is. There will be signs, but don't be surprised if you have to continue driving after the GPS says you've arrived.
