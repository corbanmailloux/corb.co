Hey! I'm Corban Mailloux. I'm a senior software engineer at [CloudHealth by VMware](https://www.cloudhealthtech.com/) based in Boston, MA where I build and maintain several components of our SaaS platform. I'm particularly focused on scaling our data ingestion pipelines, including one system running more than a million jobs per minute.
Prior to CloudHealth, I was a software engineering intern at [EnerNOC](https://www.enelx.com/) (now "Enel X") with the identity and access management team.

I'm an alumnus of [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) where I majored in software engineering with a focus on computing security. I also minored in communications.

TODO: Expand on personal stuff. Specifically the items called out on the home page:
Electric unicycler. Home automator. Rock climber. [Amateur cat trainer.](https://www.instagram.com/theladies_sashaandmaya/)
