Hey! I'm Corban Mailloux. üëãüèº

In my professional life, I'm a staff engineer at VMware/Broadcom in Massachusetts where I build and maintain several components of our SaaS platforms. I'm particularly focused on scaling our data ingestion pipelines including one system running more than a million jobs per minute. I've been through 2 acquisitions in this role: CloudHealth Technologies was acquired by VMware in 2019 and then VMware was acquired by Broadcom in 2023.

I'm an alumnus of [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/computing/) where I majored in software engineering with a focus on computing security. I also minored in communications.

Outside of work, I enjoy home improvement projects, flying FPV drones, riding [electric unicycles](https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-king-song-16x-1554wh-battery-2000w-motor-3-wide-tire/), and home automation. I've recently joined a band called [Well Suited](http://www.youtube.com/@WellSuitedBand) where you'll see me playing saxophone plus occasional backing vocals and keys.

At home, I'm a new dad (!!) and I have two cats that I've trained to do various tricks including jumping through hoops, walking upright, and heeling by my side. You can find many of wonderful cat pictures on [@theladies_sashaandmaya's Instagram {{< fontawesome instagram >}}](https://www.instagram.com/theladies_sashaandmaya/?r=nametag).

As you'll see in my [projects](/categories/projects/), I like to work on home automation projects and generally enjoy DIY electronics. I'm a big fan and occasional contributor to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), an open-source, Python-based platform that integrates with just about everything. You can find my complete Home Assistant configuration on [{{< fontawesome github >}} Github](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/home-assistant-configuration), with documentation of some of the major parts [in the repo's wiki](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/home-assistant-configuration/wiki/Packages).

I invite you to take a look at some of my previous [project write-ups](/categories/projects/) and to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corbanmailloux) or [email](mailto:web@corb.co).
