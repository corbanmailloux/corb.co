            I'm Corban Mailloux. I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.cloudhealthtech.com/" target="_blank">CloudHealth by VMware</a> in Boston, MA where I build and maintain many components of our SaaS platform. In my personal time, I'm a home automation enthusiast, rock climber, and electric unicycler.
        </p>
        <p>
            I originally set up this site to play with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. I've since moved the site onto a personal server on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> because I wanted to set up SSL/TLS on this domain and to generally have more control over the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose the domain corb.co for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>I wanted a simple, short URL that I could use for everything.</li>
            <li>I wanted to limit people spelling my name incorrectly. (You may have noticed; my name is spelled "Corban," not "Corbin.")</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Please take a look at some of my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can be contacted by using any of those pretty buttons at the top of the page.
