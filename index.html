            I'm Corban Mailloux. Nice to "meet" you. I recently graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY with a B.S. in Software Engineering, an application domain of Computer Security, and a minor in Communications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last year, I completed a software engineering co-op at <a href="https://www.enernoc.com/" target="_blank">EnerNOC, Inc.</a> in Boston, MA working on the Identity and Access Management team. Previously, I worked as a developer at <a href="http://mobiusworks.com/" target="_blank">Mobius Works</a> in Westfield, MA developing custom software and customizations to an <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> system called <a href="http://www.epicor.com/" target="_blank">Epicor</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm searching for software development work in the Boston, MA area. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I originally set up this site to play with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. I've since moved the site onto a personal server on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> because I wanted to set up SSL/TLS on this domain and to generally have more control over the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose the domain corb.co for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>I wanted a simple, short URL that I could use for everything.</li>
            <li>I wanted to limit people spelling my name incorrectly. (You may have noticed; my name is spelled "Corban," not "Corbin.")</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Please take a look at some of my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.
        </p>

            I can be contacted by using any of those pretty buttons at the top of the page.
