<p>
    In my software modeling class, we were using a relational language called Alloy. I am a big fan of Sublime Text 3 for all of my editing, so I wanted to use it for Alloy as well. After looking around, I couldn't find a syntax highlighting package for Alloy in Sublime, so I decided to make one, mostly to learn how it works, and to practice regular expressions. It now has most of the highlighting I was hoping for when I set out, but there is always room for improvement.

    I used <a href="https://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/sublime-text-2/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html" target="_blank">this guide</a> to get a basic understanding of how to get started, even though it is for Sublime Text 2.

    The project is available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/sublime-mit-alloy" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
