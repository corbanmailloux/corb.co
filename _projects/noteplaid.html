            Noteplaid is a text editor that has a plaid background. It is essentially a Windows Notepad clone <small>(<i>please don't sue me</i>)</small> built using WPF in C#.

            One day, I was talking to <a href="https://github.com/amccarthy1" target="_blank">Adam McCarthy</a> and I stuttered when saying "Notepad." Thus, the concept for Noteplaid was born. I made a GUI mockup that day, and then the project lay dormant for almost 3 months.

            <i>And then it was finals week...</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The first version was built because I was procrastinating studying for a final. It now supports saving and loading files (which seems pretty standard for a text editor) and has built-in spell check!
        </p>
        <p>
            The code, and a compiled EXE file, are available on Adam's <a href="https://github.com/amccarthy1/Noteplaid" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
