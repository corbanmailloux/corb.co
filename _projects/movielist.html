    <strong>Update:</strong>
    This project has been reimplemented in C# and combined with <a href="/projects/tvlist/">TVList</a> to create a new, fast, clean, all-in-one media manager, aptly called <a href="/projects/medialist/">MediaList</a>. Be sure to check that project out for updates, as I'll probably stop playing with MovieList and TVList now.

            MovieList is a simple Java 1.7 media manager for movie collections that span multiple drives or folders. It has also now been reimplemented in C#.
        </p>
        <p>
            MovieList allows a user to quickly search through a large movie collection that may span multiple drives or folders. It does this by quickly looking through each folder given to it, indexing the files, and keeping an organized list of all of the movies found.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also features real-time searching, a duplicate listing mode, and the ability to open a movie in Windows Explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code, and compiled JAR and EXE files, are available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/MovieList" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
