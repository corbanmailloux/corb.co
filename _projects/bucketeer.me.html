                    <a href="https://bucketeer.me" target="_blank">Bucketeer.me</a> is an online application that lets you record and track things that are on your bucket list. Bucketeer allows you to view the aspirations and achievements of your friends while also congratulating you for completing goals of your own.

            This site was built in a hackathon setting with a team of myself and three others:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/aem1269">Adam McCarthy</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://valbooth28.github.io/">Val Booth</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://friss.me/">Zach Friss</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
