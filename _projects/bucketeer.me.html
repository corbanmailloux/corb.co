Bucketeer allows you to view the aspirations and achievements of your friends while also congratulating you for completing goals of your own.

        <p>
            This site was built in a hackathon setting with a team of myself and three others:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="http://amccarthy.me/">Adam McCarthy</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://valbooth.com/">Val Booth</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://friss.me/">Zach Friss</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The site is visible at <a href="https://bucket.corb.co" target="_blank">bucket.corb.co</a>, and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/TheBricksThatHacked/Bucketeer.me" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
