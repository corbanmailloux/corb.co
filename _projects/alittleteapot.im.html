            Because I didn't feel like paying to renew it, the domain <code>alittleteapot.im</code> has now expired. I've hosted the code from the site at <a href="http://tea.corb.co" target="_blank">tea.corb.co</a>.

            <a href="http://tea.corb.co" target="_blank">alittleteapot.im</a> is a beautifully animated teapot, made with CSS animations. I initially bought the domain because I was thinking of fun Java package names. If I were to make a package called <code>ShortAndStout</code>, the package name could be <code>Im.ALittleTeapot.ShortAndStout</code>.

            To get the lettering just right, it uses <a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">animate.css</a>, <a href="http://letteringjs.com/" target="_blank">lettering.js</a>, and <a href="http://jschr.github.io/textillate/" target="_blank">textillate.js</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beautiful teapot animation, on the other hand, was made by me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result is available at <a href="http://tea.corb.co" target="_blank">tea.corb.co</a>, and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/alittleteapot.im" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
