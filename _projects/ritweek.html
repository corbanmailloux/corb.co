            Far too often at <a href="http://www.rit.edu">RIT</a>, I hear "<em>what week is it?</em>" asked between students. Fed up with never knowing, I looked to see if there was somewhere I could find a definitive answer.

            <code>&lt;spoiler&gt;</code><em>There isn't.</em><code>&lt;/spoiler&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p class="h3">Well now there is!</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://whatweekisit.rit.lol/" target="_blank">What Week Is It @ RIT?</a> is an silly website that simply answers that question. In our senior year, <a href="https://github.com/ShaydeNofziger" target="_blank">Shayde Nofziger</a> also added a countdown to graduation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site is visible at <a href="https://whatweekisit.rit.lol/" target="_blank">https://whatweekisit.rit.lol/</a>, and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/RITWeek" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
