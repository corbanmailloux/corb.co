            When I was a kid, we used to play board games as a family. One of our all-time favorites was always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Mansion_(board_game)#1990s_electronic_version" target="_blank">Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion</a>, in which the players furnish a mansion with these little pieces of furniture and then search for clues as to where the "money" is hidden. It's an awesome game, and it kind of feels like a combination of Clue and a dollhouse.

            At a recent family gathering, we went to play the game and discovered that the "computer" part wasn't reliably working. I joked that I could recreate the game... and a couple hours of tinkering later, we were playing again.

            Later on, I went back through and recorded my best impression of the talking voice. For now, the voice-overs are Windows-only, the rest of the system is running on pure Python.
